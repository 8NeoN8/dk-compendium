          Here're some tips from your old man!

            Study your opponents' projectiles
          </h3>
          <p class="tip-text">
            You absolutely have to put the time into learning the ins and outs of projectiles that are giving you trouble. There are many aspects to study about projectiles. You need to be fully aware of <u>the range they control</u> and their <u>startup + cooldown frames.</u> Knowing these aspects allow you to get a feel for when / where your opponent will throw that projectile at you and how vulnerable they are for doing so.
            <br><br>
            Pick a character in training mode, and practise firing the projectile at its maximum effective range. Shoot the projectile(s) a few times, then shield immediately afterwards to see how long a committment each one is. You'll be able to better understand the visual / audio cues much better as well, helping with reactions for seeable projectiles.
            <br><br>
            You need to put time into this step to get the most out of the most important step, which I'll get to in a bit

            Understand your anti-projectile tools
          </h3>
          <div class="tip-text">
            You have more than just a shield, take the time to learn your other options, you lazy bum!
            <br><br>
            <u>Shield</u>: Shielding can save you from damage, but keep in mind that you have to go through shieldstun and 11f to put down a shield when you're free to move if you don't wish to jump. You're also forced to stand still while shielding, which allows the opponent to take space unharassed. Parrying is an alternative option to preserve shield health and avoid having to go through the 11f to put a shield down. Keep in mind that you will go through parry-freeze, while the attacker will not.
            <br><br>
            <u>Attacks</u>: Hitting a projectile with a grounded move is generally not recommended, since you go through recoil lag and the opponent gets more time to advance. There are a couple of exceptions, however.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>First, aerial attacks do not clank, allowing you to b-air a weak projectile while still being able to strike the opponent</li>
              <li>Secondly, you can use moves like f-tilt if they'll strike the projectile and opponent simultaneously</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Also keep in mind that the more % your attack does, the more clank lag YOU suffer. gSK multihits put DK in 26f recoil lag, while early Dash Attack puts DK in 46f recoil. (Though keep the 9% rule in mind, along with the fact that Punch and all of DK's Smashes cannot rebound - be put in recoil)
            <br><br>
            <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV2xTqIf_yg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An explanation of the 9% Rule</a>
            <br><br>
            <u>Jumping</u>: Jumping has many more benefits than you would initially think. By jumping over a projectile, you completely bypass shieldstun, hitlag, and the frames required to drop a shield. You're also fully mobile during the entirety of the jump, which lets you control space more effectively. This is less useful the longer the projectile has been active for, since the opponent may be able to follow and set up juggles. We'll discuss this in the final point.
            <br><br>
            <u>Super Armor</u>: DK has 3 attacks with Super Armor, but the main one to consider is gSK, since it advances. This allows DK to essentially ignore a projectile (except for the damage he takes), and immediately fire back with an attack. Keep in mind that gSK will not blow through attacks like flamethrowers, since the armor runs out before the first active frame.
            <br><br>
            <u>Rolling / Directional Air Dodge In</u>: These allow DK to advance with intangibility, letting him navigate past a projectile. However, they do have moderate amounts of cooldown, which requires them to be pre-empted to be effective. They can be some of the most rewarding options if used correctly, however.
            <br><br>
            <u>Crouch Cancelling</u>; VS exceptionally weak projectiles, such as a Pikachu T.Jolt, a Luigi fireball, etc., DK can take advantage of his longevity and crouch cancel the fireball (hold down and take the hit). It may seem like a wild idea, but projectiles like these actually deal LESS hitstun than they do blockstun + shield hitlag + 11 frames to drop a shield. This can allow you to set up a counterattack much more reliably

            Walk, don't run
          </h3>
          <p class="tip-text">
            Take some time and smell the roses. This generation is always in such a hurry!
            <br><br>
            DK's dash is a very big committment. Upon initiating a dash, DK cannot shield until frame 16, which is when his dash transitions into a run.
            <br>
            On the other hand, DK has the 9th fastest walkspeed in the entire game, which also allows him to shield INSTANTLY. Take advantage of this to the fullest and don't take unecessary hits.

        <li class="tip-container">
          <h3 class="tip-title">
            Have a positive mentality
          </h3>
          <p class="tip-text">
            You kids turn tail and run at the first sight of trouble! It makes me sick! Pay attention to the following!
            <br><br>
            You have to maintain composure. The whole point of these projectiles is to pester you at range and to get you frustrated. If you get angry after taking just a couple of stray projectiles and just run in predictably, you're playing right into your opponent's hands. It's okay if you take a couple T.Jolts, a few fireballs here and there, etc. and is far better than the alternative, which is getting your approach read and combo'd for considerable damage.
            <br><br>
            You have to accept that as Donkey Kong, you have to pay a tax to get in on your opponent, just like Zangief has to VS Sagat in SSF2. You have to accept that you will inevitably take some damage getting in (especially if you crouch cancel), but you can make all of this up once you do manage to get in correctly. Just maintain composure and always be on the lookout for the opportune moment to get in.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="tip-container">
          <h3 class="tip-title">
            Patience
          </h3>
          <p class="tip-text">
            Consider the following. Just because the opponent has a projectile, does not mean DK is at their mercy. Let's say Mario throws a fireball and DK jumps over it. They both recover on the same frame. What was accomplished? Nothing at all. They hold no power of you. You don't always have to approach. You can just neutral jump fast fall a projectile to maintain your space.
            <br><br>
            One thing to keep in mind VS many projectile users - DK can actually gain more from being at range than they do. DK gets access to Punch windups while they can toss generally slow and weak projectiles. When DK has a fully charged Giant Punch, he gains access to several new KO confirms and punishment options, which means he is able to actively buff himself at range while the opponent is just chucking small projectiles at him.
            <br><br>
            Combining these, you can actually force your opponent to approach you, even if they have a projectile. You just need to be patient.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="tip-container">
          <h3 class="tip-title">
            Make a read & pre-empt your punish
          </h3>
          <p class="tip-text">
            This is the undisputed key way to deal with a projectile. You absolutely have to pre-empt your option if you wish to get a significant punish on a projectile. If you play via reactions, it takes ~21f to visually react to a projectile, then you have to consider the number of frames that the projectile has been on screen for, etc. If you jump on reaction to many projectiles at range, the opponent will likely be able to act by the time you get near them.
            <br><br>
            Combining all of the previous points, you need to know when a projectile is coming so that you can pre-emptively evade it and punish your opponent. In an ideal situation, you would jump / roll / etc. slightly BEFORE your opponent even releases their projectile, thus allowing you to recover from your evasive action quickly and guarantee yourself a punish while they're still in cooldown. 
            <br><br>
            Thus, you need to know how long they're open for when they throw a projectile. You need to know when / where they would throw the projectiles. You need to know which options you have to punish with. You need to keep your cool and make a calculated read at the opportune moment. It all comes together here.
